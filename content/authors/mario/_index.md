I am a researcher with extensive experience in the analysis, design, and application of (meta-)heuristic optimisation techniques. As illustrated in my publication record, I have contributed original ideas when tailoring these techniques to tackle problems with varying characteristics (combinatorial and continuous, single-objective and multi-objective, unconstrained and constrained) and from application domains such as Data Mining/Machine Learning and Bioinformatics. I have a keen taste for interdisciplinary research, and my goal is to contribute to the solution of important, real-world optimisation and computer science challenges.
