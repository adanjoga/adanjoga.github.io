I received the B.S. degree in Electronic and Communications Engineering from the Universidad Tecnológica de México in 2004. Next, I obtained the M.Sc (2006) and D.Sc. (2009) degrees in Electrical Engineering at Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del I.P.N. (CINVESTAV-IPN). Since 2010, I am full-time professor at the CINVESTAV Unidad Tamaulipas. Currently, I am SNI (National System of Researchers) member level 1. My main research fields of interest are Pattern Recognition and Digital Image Analysis.
