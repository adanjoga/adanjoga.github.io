I am a [Research Fellow in Machine Learning](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/aj504) at the Department of Computer Science, Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Exeter, United Kingdom (UK). Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the [Decision and Cognitive Sciences Research Centre](https://www.alliancembs.manchester.ac.uk/research/decision-science/), University of Manchester, UK. I hold M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, [Cinvestav-IPN](https://www.cinvestav.mx/), Mexico.


My main research interests involve the study and design of data clustering techniques based on nature-inspired metaheuristics and their applications to different research fields such as machine learning and bioinformatics. Recently, I have been focused on the development of a multi-objective evolutionary approach for multi-view data clustering and its application to a range of domains, ranging from network analysis to medical imaging data.
