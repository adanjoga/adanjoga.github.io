I am an Alan Turing Fellow and Professor in the [Decision and Cognitive Sciences Research Centre](https://www.alliancembs.manchester.ac.uk/research/decision-science/) at the University of Manchester. Prior to this I was an MRC Special Training Fellow at the University of Manchester and the University of Washington. I hold a PhD from the University of Manchester, a Masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and a Bachelor (Hons) degree from Monash University.

My research interests relate to the development and application of advanced analytical techniques (concretely, optimization methods, machine learning and simulation) for complex real-world problems, and I have on-going collaborative projects in a number of different application areas, both within and outside academia. Projects at Manchester Business School are typically focused around logistics, forecasting or segmentation problems. Many of the methods I work with have applications across disciplines, and I am involved in a number of cross-faculty collaborations at the University of Manchester e.g. through initiatives such as the Data Analytics and Society and the Quantitative Biology CDT (as the methodological rather than domain expert).
