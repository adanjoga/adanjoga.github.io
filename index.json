My main research interests involve the study and design of data clustering techniques based on nature-inspired metaheuristics and their applications to problems from areas such as digital image segmentation and machine learning. Recently, I have been focused on the development of a multiobjective evolutionary approach for multi-view data clustering and its application to a range of application domains, ranging from network analysis to medical imaging data.\nI received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from the Technological Institute of Culiacan in 2010, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico, in 2012 and 2017, respectively.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/adan-jose-garcia/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/adan-jose-garcia/","section":"authors","summary":"Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Decision and Cognitive Sciences Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.
